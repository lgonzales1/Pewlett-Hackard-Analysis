# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide executives at Pewlett-Hackard (PH) with information about the company's projected retirements over the coming years. Key variables were anlyzed, including basic employee information ranging from demographics, past and current job titles, hiring and termination dates (if applicable). The analysis of the employee data tables will potentially reduce the labor-loss impact of baby-boomers born 1952-1955 that are nearing retirement age and will enable executives and managers to examine who from the organization should participate in mentorship for knowledge and skill transfer.

## Results
Below is a set of 4 key findings from the analysis described above.

1. **Roles that are impacted**: A significant number of senior engineers are predicted to retire soon. This presents a serious threat to a company as dependent on its technical workforce as PH. Therefore, the most pressing need in terms of recruitment of new employees may be engineering talent.
2. **Impact of senior staff retiring**: Within Pewlett-Hackard, there are roughly >90k employees close to retirement. These employees, in general, hold senior roles and some are highly skilled. This will dramatically decrease the number of employeed staff with institutional knowledge and company-specific expertise across functional areas and departments. 
3. **Mentorship eligibility**: Via an Excel pivot table, we determined there are about 1500 employees eligible to be mentors. Further, a majority of these mentors (about 730) are either senior staff or senior engineers. Out of the large number of employees within PH, there are relatively few mentors. PH should look at expanding the mentorship eligibility to maintain acquired knowledge throughout the company.
4. **Strategically targeting mentors**: At PH, the mentorship program looks at those whose birth year is 1965. However, this can be ignoring the large number of other qualified candidates who can be beneficial as mentors. Perhaps PH should expand the query of existing employees to those born between 1960-1965. Or, PH can look at hire date as a variable of interest. For example, those with 15+ years of expirience can qualify for mentorship. This allows a variety of knowledge and experitise to be passed to newer employees. 

## Summary
The two essential questions asked by PH are as follows:

1. **How many roles will need to be filled?** This question is answered with the "Retiring_titles" data table which breaks down the retirements by role. In total, the number of roles to be filled is 90,398. Additional queries can be run for retirements by departments to narrow the roles and range for which management will need to fill positions.

3. **Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of PH employees?**

Throughout this analysis, we can see there is a large discrepancy between the number of total current employees and eligible mentors. Likely, because PH did not perform this analysis sooner, there will not be enough qualified, retirement-ready employees (especially in the larger departments) to mentor the next generation of employees. Executive staff may want to look into trainings and externshhips as a means for creating mentorship relationships for employees at PH.
